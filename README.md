Hey ðŸ‘‹

I am Babu Annamalai a polyglot software developer based in Bengaluru, love to work with web technologies and OSS . I am a lifetime learner in exploration mode.

I spend a plenty of time working on the following OSS projects as below:

- Co-maintainer of [Marten](http://martendb.io/). I am available in the project's gitter channel to help with any queries/questions on Marten. This is the most successful and active project in terms of user base.

- Creator and maintainer of [ReverseMarkdown.NET](https://github.com/mysticmind/reversemarkdown-net), [MysticMind.PostgresEmbed](https://github.com/mysticmind/mysticmind-postgresembed) and [.NET Sort Refs](https://github.com/mysticmind/dotnet-sort-refs)

I also contribute to other OSS projects as well.

If my work has helped you in any form or fashion, you can now buy me a coffee!<br>
